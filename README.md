Bookshelf is a WordPress plugin designed for book enthusiasts. It allows users to showcase the books they've read and create a shareable list to connect with others. By sharing their lists, readers can discover new and captivating book titles that pique their interest. Additionally, the plugin lets users maintain a wishlist of books they plan to read, helping them remember which ones to purchase next. With Bookshelf, readers can easily explore the world of literature and connect with like-minded book lovers.

<h4>Technical Details and Use Instructions:</h4>
The Bookshelf plugin offers a user-friendly interface, allowing users to fill out a form with essential book details such as description, publication year, author, genre, and an optional book image. This data is used to create a custom post type, adding the book to the user's personal collection. Each user has access to their own collection, which they can easily share on popular social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Alternatively, users can share a link to their collection. Furthermore, users can explore other users' collections and add books from those collections to their own wishlist or directly to their collection if they already possess the book.

To ensure a seamless and dynamic user experience, the wishlist and collection processes are executed using Ajax, providing instant updates without page reloads. The plugin conveniently adds a navigation menu meta box, making it effortless for users to add collections, wishlist pages, add book pages, and book archives as settled endpoints. Under the hood, the plugin defines books as a custom post type, offering specific attributes such as author, publication year, and genre. Additionally, the plugin utilizes taxonomies to categorize books by collection, author, publication year, and genre with enabling user to add new taxonomy term from the frontend.

On hover, users can see more details about a book, providing a delightful browsing experience. Overall, the Bookshelf plugin provides a robust and comprehensive solution for readers to organize, share, and discover new books effortlessly.
